// Create a simple console program that monitors HTTP traffic on your machine:
// 1. Sniff network traffic to detect HTTP activity.
// 2. Every 10s, display in the console the sections of the web site with the most
//    hits (a section is defined as being what's before the second '/' in a URL. i.e.
//    the section for "http://my.site.com/pages/create' is "http://my.site.com/pages"),
//    as well as interesting summary statistics on the traffic as a whole.
// 3. Make sure a user can keep the console app running and monitor traffic on their machine.
// 4. Whenever total traffic for the past 2 minutes exceeds a certain number on average,
//    add a message saying that “High traffic generated an alert - hits = {value}, triggered at {time}”.
// 5. Whenever the total traffic drops again below that value on average for the past 2
//    minutes, add another message detailing when the alert recovered.
// 6. Whenever the total traffic drops again below that value on average for the past 2
//    minutes, add another message detailing when the alert recovered.
// 7. Make sure all messages showing when alerting thresholds are crossed remain visible
//    on the page for historical reasons.
// 8. Write a test for the alerting logic.
// 9. Explain how you’d improve on this application design.
